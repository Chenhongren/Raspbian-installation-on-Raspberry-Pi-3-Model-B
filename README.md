# INTRODUCTION

The Raspberry Pi 3 is the third-generation Raspberry Pi. It replaced the Raspberry Pi 2 Model B in February 2016. This latest model (Raspberry Pi 3) includes 802.11n WiFi, Bluetooth 4.0, and a quad-core 64-bit ARM Cortex A53 running at 1.2 GHz. It’s a usable desktop computer. 

And the goal of this manual is to thus guide you step-by-step through the compile and installation process. There are ten parts in this document. If you follow these steps, you can operate image processing using OpenCV on the Raspberry Pi 3 Model B. Anyway, let’s go ahead and get started installing OpenCV 3 on your brand-new Raspberry Pi 3 running Raspbian Jessie.
