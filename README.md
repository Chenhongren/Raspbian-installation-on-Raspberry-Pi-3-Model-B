# INTRODUCTION

The Raspberry Pi 3 is the third-generation Raspberry Pi. It replaced the Raspberry Pi 2 Model B in February 2016. This latest model (Raspberry Pi 3) includes 802.11n WiFi, Bluetooth 4.0, and a quad-core 64-bit ARM Cortex A53 running at 1.2 GHz. It’s a usable desktop computer. 

And the goal of this manual is to thus guide you step-by-step through the compile and installation process. There are ten parts in this document. If you follow these steps, you can operate image processing using OpenCV on the Raspberry Pi 3 Model B. Anyway, let’s go ahead and get started installing OpenCV 3 on your brand-new Raspberry Pi 3 running Raspbian Jessie.

# Raspbian Installation Step
- __Windows(Recommend)__:

  - __Step1__： Download the “SD Card formatter” from the URL below 
  
       https://www.sdcard.org/cht/downloads/formatter_4/
       
  - __Step2__： Download the Win32DiskImager utility from the Sourceforge Project page as a zip file; you can run this from a USB drive.
  
       https://sourceforge.net/projects/win32diskimager/

  - __Step3__：Extract the executable from the zip file and run the Win32DiskImager utility; you may need to run this as administrator. Right-click on the file, and select Run as administrator.
  
  - __Step4__： Select the image file you extracted earlier.
 
  - __Step5__：Select the drive letter of the SD card in the device box. Be careful to select the correct drive; if you get the wrong one you can destroy the data on your computer's hard disk! If you are using an SD card slot in your computer and can't see the drive in the Win32DiskImager window, try using an external SD adapter.
  
  - __Step6__：Click Write and wait for the write to complete.
  
  - __Step7__：Exit the imager and eject the SD card.
